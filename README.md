# MyTemplates

mtpl (as in MyTemplates) is a small script/files templates manager that uses git.

# Why

Often scripting, I have a lot of small pieces of scripts, code, licences or configurations files that I frequently copy/paste from websites. This is boring and inconvenient (forgetting the website's address, slow, too many steps, tends to leads to error, etc...). A perfect task to solve with the power of code.

Also, sharing is cool.

# How

So how to store and distribute a bunch of small pieces of code/text that will evolve in time and if possible with different versions of the "bunch"? Well git + branch is a perfect solution. But git alone doesn't really fit such use. So, let's build a small interface on top of it.

# What

And voil√†, you have a small script that use the power of git to distribute and share severals templates of script/code/licences/configuration files with a simple and powerful way to select one of it without caring on how git is working behind.

# Usage

    mtpl

List templates. At the first launch, mtpl will clone the git repository to get the script. <code>mtpl update</code> update the content of the repository.

    mtpl template_name

Display template on stdout.

    mtpl part_of_template_name

Display matching template on stdout or the list of matching templates if there is more than one.

    mtpl update

Update the templates' repository.

# I want to add a new template!

Jut add a new file in <code>~/.config/mytemplates/</code>.

# I want to propose a new template to the official repository!

Well, lucky you are, you already have a git repository in <code>~/.config/mytemplates/</code>. After you have added the file, commited and pushed somewhere just send me an email at cortex@worlddomination.be. You can also fork the github repository [here](https://github.com/Psycojoker/mytemplates) and send me a pull request (easier).

# Licence

Templates are in the public domain. MyTemplates is under agplv3+.
